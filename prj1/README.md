### Line Drawing Implementation

Implemented the Bresenham and Midpoint line drawing algorithms using the OpenGL library.
Utilizes my implementation of the Bresenham line drawing algorithm to display the text "HELLO."
My implementation of the Midpoint line drawing algorithm allows users to draw their own line segments by selecting control points with mouse click.
