### Bezier Surface and Lighting

Implemented a Bezier surface defined by 16 control points.
Users can change the location of 4 of these control points in order to warp the shape of the Bezier surface.
Used the lighting functions from OpenGL to illuminate the Bezier surface.
Users can change different lighting parameters such as the specular exponent(which controls shininess), the diffuse coefficient, and the location of the light source.
