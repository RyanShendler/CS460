### Triangulation of a Sphere

I developed an algorithm to render a triangular mesh of a sphere centered at the origin.
Uses spherical coordinate system to generate vertices along the lines of latitude.
Uses OpenGL to draw triangular face connecting these vertices.
My implementation allows users to change the radius and level of detail of the triangular mesh.
